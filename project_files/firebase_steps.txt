Datastore (not really firebase)
gcloud datastore indexes create index.yaml

Firebase
console.firebase.google.com
select existing project
confirm me-ing plan
Tutorial instructions are not quite right. "Add firebase to your webapp" is hard to find.

Under project settings general, look for "</>" which means web I guess. Click through that.


Tutorial says add to head, wizard says end of body, but before any firebase use (which means beginning of body)

Firebase usually automatically adds the appropriate appspot authorized domain.

Tutorial neglects to mention to add this. It's part of that "TODO products you want to use" I guess.
